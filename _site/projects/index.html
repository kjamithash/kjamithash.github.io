<p>Experimenting with the concepts present in the book “Programming Pytorch for Deep Learning” by Ian Pointer. 
I create the following models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a simple neural network to classify the Fashion MNSIT dataset.</li>
  <li>Create a convolution neural network to classify the Fashion MNSIT dataset.</li>
  <li>Experiment with transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the CNN model.</li>
  <li>Using tensorboard to visualize a neural network with Pytorch</li>
</ul>
